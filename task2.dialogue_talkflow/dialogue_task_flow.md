### 🧠 User Type A: Emotional Type（情绪型）

- 特点：表达情绪多、语言带有主观感受，需要共情与安全感

#### Round 1 - [Goal: Encourage expression]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: I just feel overwhelmed all the time... I don’t even know why anymore. 

AI: I hear you. Feeling overwhelmed can build up slowly until it’s hard to even name why we feel that way. Would you like to talk about what’s been on your mind lately?

**Logic (ZH):** 鼓励用户表达情绪，同时提供接纳感，降低表达门槛。

#### Round 2 - [Goal: Identify context or trigger]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: Maybe it's work… deadlines, messages piling up… I just want to disappear for a while. 

AI: Sounds like work has been really intense for you. When the pressure doesn’t stop, it’s totally natural to want to escape. Is there a specific moment that made it feel worse recently?

**Logic (ZH):** 通过追问具体情境，帮助用户定位焦虑来源。

#### Round 3 - [Goal: Normalize and validate]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: Yeah… last week my manager asked me to redo everything on a tight deadline.

 AI: That sounds exhausting and unfair. It’s valid to feel frustrated and drained when your effort isn’t respected. You’re not alone in this.

**Logic (ZH):** 通过共情和价值认同，稳定用户情绪。

#### Round 4 - [Goal: Introduce reflection]

**Prompt (EN):** 
AI: When things like this happen, do you find yourself blaming yourself or feeling like it’s your fault?

**Logic (ZH):** 引导用户内省，识别潜在思维偏差。

#### Round 5 - [Goal: Cognitive reframing]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: Maybe I should’ve done better... 

AI: That’s a common thought when we’re under stress, but let’s look at the facts — you were asked to redo work under pressure. What you’re experiencing isn’t a failure, it’s a reaction to a tough environment.

**Logic (ZH):** 使用 REBT 进行认知重构，弱化非理性信念。

#### Round 6 - [Goal: Emotional relief and next step]

**Prompt (EN):** 
AI: What’s something small you could do today just for yourself? Not to solve anything, just to feel a little lighter?

**Logic (ZH):** 从解决问题转为关注自我恢复，落地情绪支持。

### 🧠 User Type B: Rational Type（理性型）

- 特点：以问题和逻辑为主，需要结构和方向感

#### Round 1 - [Goal: Acknowledge stress and build rapport]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: I’ve been feeling stuck, but I don’t want to waste time venting. 
AI: That’s completely okay. Let’s look at what’s been causing the sense of being stuck — maybe we can unpack it logically together.

**Logic (ZH):** 用结构性语言建立信任，让对方接受情绪对话。

#### Round 2 - [Goal: Surface stressor]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: I think I’ve been inefficient lately, and it’s making me anxious. 
AI: Got it. Anxiety often points to a gap between expectations and current outcomes. Would you like to explore what’s been holding your efficiency back?

**Logic (ZH):** 将情绪转化为目标偏差，引导进入自我分析。

#### Round 3 - [Goal: Reframe expectation]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: I just can’t focus like I used to.
 AI: Focus can fluctuate for many reasons — mental load, sleep, even pressure itself. Let’s define what “productive” would realistically look like for you right now.

**Logic (ZH):** 建立合理化参照，缓解非理性自我要求。

#### Round 4 - [Goal: Propose strategy]

**Prompt (EN):** 
AI: Based on what you shared, a short focus + break cycle might help. Would you like to try a 25-min deep work block with a 5-min check-in after?

**Logic (ZH):** 给出结构化方法，赋予可控感。

#### Round 5 - [Goal: Reinforce agency and exit]

**Prompt (EN):** 
User: I’ll give that a shot. 
AI: Great — you’re not stuck, you’re already moving. Let me know how it goes. I’ll be here anytime you want to reflect or adapt the plan.

**Logic (ZH):** 强化行动力和自主感，构建积极闭环。

## 两种类型用户对比及我的处理逻辑

其实主要对应男性和女性，男性喜欢理性分析型的REBT，女性喜欢吐槽安慰式的倾诉获取安全感
（这里是我的主观看法，不够客观，后面看大家怎么感觉再具体设计。
后面加入一个分析用户画像的模块，用户注册SynAI的时候就让她/他填一些东西，我们可以通过一个Agent来这样做，进行信息收集。 这样可以有一个初始的逻辑，后面再根据对话内容优化）
